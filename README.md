This example highlights a subtle issue with Kotlin's collection immutability. The `listOf()` function creates immutable lists. While the code works as expected, attempts to modify these lists (e.g., adding or removing elements) will result in runtime exceptions.  The solution demonstrates how to use mutable collections when modifications are needed.
In Kotlin, when you use listOf(), it creates an immutable list, which means you cannot modify the list by adding or removing elements. This is because the collection is read-only, and any attempts to alter its structure at runtime will throw exceptions (typically UnsupportedOperationException).

For instance:

kotlin

val myList = listOf(1, 2, 3)
myList.add(4)  // Throws UnsupportedOperationException at runtime
If you need a collection that can be modified (i.e., elements can be added, removed, or changed), you should use a mutable collection. Kotlin provides mutableListOf() for creating lists that are mutable:

kotlin

val mutableList = mutableListOf(1, 2, 3)
mutableList.add(4)  // This works, as it's a mutable list
println(mutableList)  // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]


listOf() creates an immutable list, and you cannot modify it.
mutableListOf() creates a mutable list that allows modifications like adding or removing elements.
This distinction is crucial because Kotlin's immutable collections are designed to promote immutability and safer concurrent programming, while mutable collections are available when modification is required. When using collections in Kotlin, it's always a good idea to consider whether you need the collection to be mutable or immutable, based on the operations you'll perform on it.
